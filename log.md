**Today's Progress**:
1.  I am trying to figure out how to work at the first place as i am not able to find or locate whatever i supposed to do.

2. The way i understand this project is that one has to choose project of their own liking, am i right? 
I mean in essence it's nice but there is a small problem, that is it is hard for the newcommers who just started with the coding. It gets hard to imagine something at the first place.

3. I wish if there was some kind of already some guiding material i.e., courses available such as on freeCodeCamp.
Such as some pythone jyputer libraries to work on or any other guiding courses that that a novice could follow. 

4. Right now i am tryong to find out what should i look for i.e., trying to search for some courses on freeCodeCamp to guide myself.

5. Ok i am figuring out something about #100DayofCode. It's like a diary entry 

6. First thing i want to do is to complete two courses. No nothing heavy programming/coding. Just want to clear some basics. 

**First:** complete the #CodeInPlace which i joined in March 2021 offered by Stanford University. 

**Second:** I am also doing another small python library course to learn the basics.

These two are my priorities right now.

All though today i learned bout Github and really able to clone and worked on the clone library in Github.

 <!-- Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. -->

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
