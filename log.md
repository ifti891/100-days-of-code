# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2021 (Example 1)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**:

**Started with the Challenge**

1.  I am trying to figure out how to work at the first place as i am not able to find or locate whatever i supposed to do.

2. The way i understand this project is that one has to choose project of their own liking, am i right? 
I mean in essence it's nice but there is a small problem, that is it is hard for the newcommers who just started with the coding. It gets hard to imagine something at the first place.

3. I wish if there was some kind of already some guiding material i.e., courses available such as on freeCodeCamp.
Such as some pythone jyputer libraries to work on or any other guiding courses that that a novice could follow. 

4. Right now i am trying to find out what should i look for i.e., trying to search for some courses on freeCodeCamp to guide myself.

5. Ok i am figuring out something about #100DayofCode. It's like a diary entry 

6. First thing i want to do is to complete two courses. No nothing heavy programming/coding. Just want to clear some basics. 

**First:** complete the #CodeInPlace which i joined in March 2021 offered by Stanford University. 

**Second:** I am also doing another small python library course to learn the basics.

These two are my priorities right now.

All though today i learned bout Github and really able to clone and worked on the clone library in Github.

 <!-- Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** Yes struggled and confused and also at the same time i am under huge work load but still going to complete this challenge.

I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the learning building a cat app on freecodecamp.
Completed around 36% of the excercise. 

**Thoughts**: Right now i am cool and understand but i belive it will eventuly get harder as i learn more and more.

I am currently building some webapp on FreeCodeCamp, i have compleated the 68% of the course. And actually enjoying it. I hope i will be able to continue the 100DaysChallenge. 

The only problem i am face is internet. first i don't have enough data. I connect to my smartphone through a hotspot. The data is only 2GB per day which is what i can afford right on a phone network. Fiber is not available in my area. And the other issues is I don't know when the state governemet will shutdown the Internet, which is pretty common here. But at the same time it's cold here and our home are not that kind of warm where one can sit down in peace and work.

But but as i am also applying for some PhD's in foreign countries which take aways a very lot of my time. Thinking, writing, waiting, and also trying to learn some new skills for future jobs (that's why i am learning coding) in very very irregular electricty.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
