# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2021 (Example 1)

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**:

**Started with the Challenge**

1. I am trying to figure out how to work at the first place as i am not able to find or locate whatever i supposed to do.

2. The way i understand this project is that one has to choose project of their own liking, am i right? I mean in essence it's nice but there is a small problem, that is it is hard for the newcommers who just started with the coding. It gets hard to imagine something at the first place.

3. I wish if there was some kind of already some guiding material i.e., courses available such as on freeCodeCamp. Such as some pythone jyputer libraries to work on or any other guiding courses that that a novice could follow.

4. Right now i am trying to find out what should i look for i.e., trying to search for some courses on freeCodeCamp to guide myself.

5. Ok i am figuring out something about #100DayofCode. It's like a diary entry

6. First thing i want to do is to complete two courses. No nothing heavy programming/coding. Just want to clear some basics.

**First:** complete the #CodeInPlace which i joined in March 2021 offered by Stanford University.

**Second:** I am also doing another small python library course to learn the basics.

These two are my priorities right now.

All though today i learned bout Github and really able to clone and worked on the clone library in Github.

 <!-- Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** Yes struggled and confused and also at the same time i am under huge work load but still going to complete this challenge.

I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

### Day 0: December 22, 2021

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the learning building a cat app on freecodecamp.
Completed around 36% of the excercise.

**Thoughts**: Right now i am cool and understand but i belive it will eventuly get harder as i learn more and more.

I am currently building some webapp on FreeCodeCamp, i have compleated the 68% of the course. And actually enjoying it. I hope i will be able to continue the 100DaysChallenge.

The problem i am facing is internet. first i don't have enough data. I connect to my smartphone through a hotspot. The data is only 2GB per day which is what i can afford right on a phone network. Fiber is not available in my area. And the other issues is I don't know when the state governemet will shutdown the Internet, which is pretty common here. But at the same time it's cold here and our home are not that kind of warm where one can sit down in peace and work.

But but as i am also applying for some PhD's in foreign countries which take aways a very lot of my time. Thinking, writing, waiting, and also trying to learn some new skills for future jobs (that's why i am learning coding) in very very irregular electricty.

### Day 1: December 23, Theusday 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
learnt basics of HTML
learned ordered lists, unordered lists, checkboxes, radio, (div) container, full page html production such as DOCTYPE, head, body, meta.

Compleated the 100% of first excercises of building CapAPP

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling, i am also learning python.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence) -->

### Day 2: December 24, Friday 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Today i started with CSS after completing the basic of HTML on #FreeCodeCamp.

1. i don't know why i was never introduced to even basic programming earlier when i was in school or even in college.
2. I really enjoy coding but i need stimuli because if there is no purpose the person keep up for long.
3. Right now the stimuli i have is to get beet and make a website for myself and later learn bit more so that i can apply for a junier (whats the spellings of junier?) developer.
4. Unrolled from Harvard #CS50 i will return to the course after getting my grip over Python.
5. It didn't aligned with my goals.
6. Though spent around 6 hours on the course and now decided that CS50 is not for me. Becasue i am learning Python and want to learn it more and better.

**Thoughts:**
I enojoy it and committed to continue the journey for longer and get better. Aside from Web designing i am also learning python at my ow descrition.

## Day 3: December 25 (Merry Christmas Day), Saturday 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent around 2.5 hours learning the different aspect of programming.
2. Browsed through Odin Project to check if i can also learn from there apart from FreeCodeCamp. But odin Project reguires much bigger setup which i didn't have right now apart from not being available on Windows platfor. But Web development coure is very enticing on odin project.
3. Completed basic HTML, now at 75% of CSS.

**Thought's**
The proble is that i think i have to revisit and revise all those functions which i am going through on FreeCodeCamp. I can solve the problems but then again if i return to some previous proble without having explicitly mentions what to do, i do get stuck.

But i think this sort of a proble is something which everyone might be facing. All in all i am enjoying my Webdevelopment Journey along with Python i am learning, for which was slected for Stanfords's Code In Place Python course.

## Day 4: December 26, Sunday 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic CSS after completing basic HTML on FreeCodeCamp.
2. Happy with the progress though.
3. Also thinking to join a bootcamp on Fullstack development offered freely by Leon:
[Twitter/leonnoel] (<https://leonnoel.com/twitter>)
[Twitch/leonnoel] (<https://leonnoel.com/twitch>) (<https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon>)

4. It's a full commited course and i hope i will be able to do justice to it.

**Thought's**

The only issue with the bootcamp is that i have very limited data and i have to use it c=judicesly i might not be able to watch it live as always. But i wll figure out. Nevertheless i am excited.

 And i received just another PhD rejecction for which i was hopping and applied for. Well i think these things happen, we got to learn to move ahead instead of sticking to failure's and ruminating on them. Guess what i am doing i doing something i love and never got the chance to explore earlier. I will be a Fullstack developer sooner than later.

 Though i completed basic CSS and basic HTML on freecodecamp but i kind of struggling, however, i know more than what i knew earlier.

## Day 5: December 27, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. 37% of basic applied visual design on FreeCodeCamp is completed
2. By end of the night will play with python. Will be watching the 9th lecture of Code in Place in which i was selected by the Stanford University.

**Thought's**

Right now it's going smooth, but i think Html and CSS is practice and after vbeing done with HTML and CSS i will revise them properly to get the basic into my head properly.

## Day 6: December 28, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic applied visual design 65%.
2. Topic's covered are color theory, how they can be represented in different form.
3. Along with color theory some of the basic design principles are also covered, such as bodering of a box, changing locations etc.

**Thought's**

Topic's are not hard to grasp but need practice. I rather enjoy it. Kind of feel little angry today. As my 2GB internet data got exausted. And i feel kind of bad that i still don't have a regular internet. All in all i am good and learning. Exaustation of data mean's i will not able able to to any work today such as i have to apply for  PhD scholarship and look for other opportunities.

## Day 7: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic applied visual design.
2. Also spent around 2 hours on python, however with minimal output of learning. Kind of slow learner actually but also many of the times very fast, if i grasp the concepts.
3. Found a free web development course offered by Helsiniki University. Will start sooner.

**Thought's**

The problem i am facing is that i am kind of stuck in this learning process, i mean a hell of introduction level learning process.

The problem i am facing even i understand the concepts, i face extreme proble to remember the names of functions to move ahead. but i am trying and i think i need revisions and i will be good to go.

## Day 8: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Started with Applied accessibility in HTML and CSS, to know more how the internet can become more insclusive when it is the developers are well read and understand the needs of people.

2. Completed 50% of the course on Applied accessibility after completing basic HTML, CSS and applied visual design.

**Thought's**

I found applied accessibilty to be more useful and easy to learn but agiain i am facing the problem of remembering all of the functions. I think they will come with practice. And i am determined to continue this journey.

Along with this my Python journey continues. first

I haven't started with Javascript yet as i am yet to find a better tutorial or intridtuction to start with. I looked up and bbut i didn't found any good tutorial where i can start. Although i am continuly looking for the it on the internet.
