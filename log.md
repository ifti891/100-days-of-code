# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2021 (Example 1)

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**:

**Started with the Challenge**

1. I am trying to figure out how to work at the first place as i am not able to find or locate whatever i supposed to do.

2. The way i understand this project is that one has to choose project of their own liking, am i right? I mean in essence it's nice but there is a small problem, that is it is hard for the newcommers who just started with the coding. It gets hard to imagine something at the first place.

3. I wish if there was some kind of already some guiding material i.e., courses available such as on freeCodeCamp. Such as some pythone jyputer libraries to work on or any other guiding courses that that a novice could follow.

4. Right now i am trying to find out what should i look for i.e., trying to search for some courses on freeCodeCamp to guide myself.

5. Ok i am figuring out something about #100DayofCode. It's like a diary entry

6. First thing i want to do is to complete two courses. No nothing heavy programming/coding. Just want to clear some basics.

**First:** complete the #CodeInPlace which i joined in March 2021 offered by Stanford University.

**Second:** I am also doing another small python library course to learn the basics.

These two are my priorities right now.

All though today i learned bout Github and really able to clone and worked on the clone library in Github.

 <!-- Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** Yes struggled and confused and also at the same time i am under huge work load but still going to complete this challenge.

I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

### Day 0: December 22, 2021

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the learning building a cat app on freecodecamp.
Completed around 36% of the excercise.

**Thoughts**: Right now i am cool and understand but i belive it will eventuly get harder as i learn more and more.

I am currently building some webapp on FreeCodeCamp, i have compleated the 68% of the course. And actually enjoying it. I hope i will be able to continue the 100DaysChallenge.

The problem i am facing is internet. first i don't have enough data. I connect to my smartphone through a hotspot. The data is only 2GB per day which is what i can afford right on a phone network. Fiber is not available in my area. And the other issues is I don't know when the state governemet will shutdown the Internet, which is pretty common here. But at the same time it's cold here and our home are not that kind of warm where one can sit down in peace and work.

But but as i am also applying for some PhD's in foreign countries which take aways a very lot of my time. Thinking, writing, waiting, and also trying to learn some new skills for future jobs (that's why i am learning coding) in very very irregular electricty.

### Day 1: December 23, Theusday 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
learnt basics of HTML
learned ordered lists, unordered lists, checkboxes, radio, (div) container, full page html production such as DOCTYPE, head, body, meta.

Compleated the 100% of first excercises of building CapAPP

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling, i am also learning python.

<!-- **Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence) -->

### Day 2: December 24, Friday 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Today i started with CSS after completing the basic of HTML on #FreeCodeCamp.

1. i don't know why i was never introduced to even basic programming earlier when i was in school or even in college.
2. I really enjoy coding but i need stimuli because if there is no purpose the person keep up for long.
3. Right now the stimuli i have is to get beet and make a website for myself and later learn bit more so that i can apply for a junier (whats the spellings of junier?) developer.
4. Unrolled from Harvard #CS50 i will return to the course after getting my grip over Python.
5. It didn't aligned with my goals.
6. Though spent around 6 hours on the course and now decided that CS50 is not for me. Becasue i am learning Python and want to learn it more and better.

**Thoughts:**
I enojoy it and committed to continue the journey for longer and get better. Aside from Web designing i am also learning python at my ow descrition.

## Day 3: December 25 (Merry Christmas Day), Saturday 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent around 2.5 hours learning the different aspect of programming.
2. Browsed through Odin Project to check if i can also learn from there apart from FreeCodeCamp. But odin Project reguires much bigger setup which i didn't have right now apart from not being available on Windows platfor. But Web development coure is very enticing on odin project.
3. Completed basic HTML, now at 75% of CSS.

**Thought's**
The proble is that i think i have to revisit and revise all those functions which i am going through on FreeCodeCamp. I can solve the problems but then again if i return to some previous proble without having explicitly mentions what to do, i do get stuck.

But i think this sort of a proble is something which everyone might be facing. All in all i am enjoying my Webdevelopment Journey along with Python i am learning, for which was slected for Stanfords's Code In Place Python course.

## Day 4: December 26, Sunday 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic CSS after completing basic HTML on FreeCodeCamp.
2. Happy with the progress though.
3. Also thinking to join a bootcamp on Fullstack development offered freely by Leon:
[Twitter/leonnoel] (<https://leonnoel.com/twitter>)
[Twitch/leonnoel] (<https://leonnoel.com/twitch>) (<https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon>)

4. It's a full commited course and i hope i will be able to do justice to it.

**Thought's**

The only issue with the bootcamp is that i have very limited data and i have to use it c=judicesly i might not be able to watch it live as always. But i wll figure out. Nevertheless i am excited.

 And i received just another PhD rejecction for which i was hopping and applied for. Well i think these things happen, we got to learn to move ahead instead of sticking to failure's and ruminating on them. Guess what i am doing i doing something i love and never got the chance to explore earlier. I will be a Fullstack developer sooner than later.

 Though i completed basic CSS and basic HTML on freecodecamp but i kind of struggling, however, i know more than what i knew earlier.

## Day 5: December 27, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. 37% of basic applied visual design on FreeCodeCamp is completed
2. By end of the night will play with python. Will be watching the 9th lecture of Code in Place in which i was selected by the Stanford University.

**Thought's**

Right now it's going smooth, but i think Html and CSS is practice and after vbeing done with HTML and CSS i will revise them properly to get the basic into my head properly.

## Day 6: December 28, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic applied visual design 65%.
2. Topic's covered are color theory, how they can be represented in different form.
3. Along with color theory some of the basic design principles are also covered, such as bodering of a box, changing locations etc.

**Thought's**

Topic's are not hard to grasp but need practice. I rather enjoy it. Kind of feel little angry today. As my 2GB internet data got exausted. And i feel kind of bad that i still don't have a regular internet. All in all i am good and learning. Exaustation of data mean's i will not able able to to any work today such as i have to apply for  PhD scholarship and look for other opportunities.

## Day 7: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed basic applied visual design.
2. Also spent around 2 hours on python, however with minimal output of learning. Kind of slow learner actually but also many of the times very fast, if i grasp the concepts.
3. Found a free web development course offered by Helsiniki University. Will start sooner.

**Thought's**

The problem i am facing is that i am kind of stuck in this learning process, i mean a hell of introduction level learning process.

The problem i am facing even i understand the concepts, i face extreme proble to remember the names of functions to move ahead. but i am trying and i think i need revisions and i will be good to go.

## Day 8: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

1. Started with Applied accessibility in HTML and CSS, to know more how the internet can become more insclusive when it is the developers are well read and understand the needs of people.

2. Completed 50% of the course on Applied accessibility after completing basic HTML, CSS and applied visual design.

**Thought's**

I found applied accessibilty to be more useful and easy to learn but agiain i am facing the problem of remembering all of the functions. I think they will come with practice. And i am determined to continue this journey.

Along with this my Python journey continues. first

I haven't started with Javascript yet as i am yet to find a better tutorial or intridtuction to start with. I looked up and bbut i didn't found any good tutorial where i can start. Although i am continuly looking for the it on the internet.

## Day 9: December 31, 2021 (Happy New Year)

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed 100% of Applied accessibility chapter on FreeCodeCamp 
2. Till now HTLM, CSS, Applied Visual design and Applied accessibility.
3. Along with it i am also continuing learning Python and almost at the finishing stage of Code in Place course which was offered by Standford University. 
4. Haven't found any good JavaScript course online all those might be better are hidden behind a paywall. Altthogh start with Googles App called Grasshopper for basic of Javascript.

**Thought's**

Certainly i feel little more learned after taking a organised course from FreeCodeCamp. I wish i had started earlier i might have learned way more. As i alred have the grasp of the ideas. 
Though syntax are bit a challenge, but i know thats only for the earlier days.

#HappyNewYear to everyone who want's to change there career and wants to move to programming and webdeveloping and doing this challenge #100DaysOfCode

## Day 10: January 1, 2022 (Happy New Year)

**Today's Progress:**

1. Today started with Responsive Web Design Principles, as it was a small chapter related to other CSS properties, doen't took much time to complete.

2. Started with CSS Flexbox, completed 25%.

**Thought's**

I moving fast i mean i am learning something and learning fast. Although i belive when i will reach at the project stage i will have to revise from the start becasue the Syntax are hard to remember. They re way too many to remember.

Along with it i am still going through Python, hopefully i will be able to finish the course.

With all this i am also going through some of the PhD stuff i have applied to, i have to send a writup to be considered for the next round of interview. Many i hat this much of shit.

## Day 11: January 2, 2022 (Still Happy New Year)

**Today's Progress**

1. Completed CSS Flexbox (100%) on FreeCodeCamp.
2. Not hard but challenging, challenging in way that remembering that many number of syntax that's challenging. 
3. Started with CSS Grid
4. Aside from this i am also learning basic Javascript but haven't mentioned here.

**Thought's**

Spending more than 4 hours a day, although except +FreeCodeCamp i not able to see much progress in me. But that's also kind of a lie. I am actually progressing. Reached quite far in Python. Still taking time to finish Python. Also started basic Javascript. I am doing Python because i started with Python earlier and i don't want to leave that in the middle of nowwher. 


## Day 12: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**

1. Completed CSS Grid. It's little bit though actually, not conceptually; which i understand crealy by remembering those functions and syntaxes.

2. Also spent some time with Python and spent some time with Distionaries. Understood that basic of distionaries but i need to understand the proper use of the disctionaries.

**Thought's**

I will revise once again for once beacuse to understand bit more the fuctionailities of those functions. Alongwith it will at the same time build my first  website without any wait that i will start only when i know all the concepts. I will start it now.


## Day 13: january 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**

1. Still learining, has been 5 hours i guess and inbetween i ret too.
2. Completed the Webdesigning course on FreeCodeCamp, and revising along with.
3. Started working on the first project after finishing the course.
4. stuck in the middle though, but i am enjoying it.

**Thought's**

I am enjoying it i wish if i knew earlier about FreeCodeCamp, i knew about lot of places where one can learn coding but unfortunatly i didn't knew about FreeCodeCamp.
Joined a 30 weeks bootcamp with #LearnWithLeon #100Dev, it will start soon. I think i am bokked ofr few months.

## Day 14: January 5, 2022

1. Worked on the same [Tribute page](https://codepen.io/ifti891/pen/wvrjwXP) 
2. Cleaned the codes which were going here and there.
3. Made website cleaner
4. While continuing writing for those PhD positions, they are taking on my nerve now. 

**Thought's**

It's snowing outside and light constantly goes out whatever time i get when there is some electricity i do something. While continuing my journey into webdevelopment. Beside it i also started learning some Javascript. And also learning python because i want to finish the course i had taken. so i am actully near. 

## Day 15: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Polished the the first project after finishing Responsive Web Design on FreeCodeCamp.
2. Finished the website building and it looks wonderful actully. Experimented a lot with CSS codes.

 *Here are the links below:*  
 [ *Here is the link* ](https://codepen.io/ifti891/pen/KKXeLqm) and [*Github Repository*](https://github.com/ifti891/first-website-finished-FreeCodeCamp-project.git)

3. Learned Github, rather better now.
4. VS Code in a better way.
5. Classes for 30 weeks Web developer Bootcamp starting on 11th January 2022. 

**Thought's**

I am making Progress, and i am really happy that i enjoy programming, which i always wanted to do. Althoug always ignored due to family and prees pressure in search for low paying jobs and stable career which never came for me. And to some extent my own failure to realise earlier. I still have to send a write up for the PhD program i have applied and i am not able to do it. Because my heart is somewhere else. 

## Day 16: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**

1. Not much actually, rather dismall. 
2. Started working on the second project but was dishonest, and looked at the solved one so it's not a great thing. But i am still learning but at the same time i didn't lookd all ove the solution.
3. Here is the link to the second Project i am doing on FreeCodeCamp [link to project](https://codepen.io/ifti891/pen/xxXJWYx?editors=1000). But it's just small one.
4. Learned desinging a survey in HTML and CSS and also taking some of Javascript's help.

**Thought's**

Actually under pressure right now, have to send a write up for my PhD selection for which i have applied, and i reached in last 16. So now i have to submit some more information to reach further into an interview by 14th of this January, And i haven't wrote a work, I am confused.

With pressue of a Job and the BootCamp i am taking this year, i don't know how long will i be able to continue it, though i very much committed. But my parent's are not happy and i am also under pressure. Hopefully i wiil be able to do some thing this year.

## Day 17: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progres**

1. No electricty for whole 2 days, so could only able to spend some very little time of the learning.
2. Only about half hour i think, worked on the second project did small changes.
3. Though by the night i tried to learn some Javascript on my Smartphone.
4. Yes wrote a small javascrip program.

  **// # This program converts dollors to Yen 

function inYen(dollars, ) {
  let amount = dollars * 113;
  return amount;
}

console.log('20 US dollars is: ');
console.log(inYen(20) +
' Japanese yen');
console.log('100 US dollars is: ');
console.log(inYen(100) + 
' Japanese yen');** 

**Tought's**
Running little under pressure related to future. Also has to send a write-up for PhD, which i am not able to write, sort of foggy bain. Though started today somewhat, hopefully i will be able to write something by 14th of january and be able to sent it to the professor. It's a huge opportunity for as i am the first from my family to cross high school and later did a master. And i never dreamt of such a thing. 
Though JavaScrip seems little tough nut to crack but i am committed. I am facing little problem with CSS tho. not just CSS but also HTML.


## Day 18: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Spent around one and half hour on the FreeCodeCamp 2nd project.
2. Facing learning curve with CSS but also with HTML too. But CSS mostly.
3. Can measure my progress from the first day, i can see i didn't knew anything about HTML and CSS some 18 day's ago, now it seems i am somewhere else.

**Thought's**

Electricity came back, but not regualrly, this will be same for around 3 months from now on. I have to adjust my calender accordingly. As the classes for the wonderfull 30 weeks bootcamp starting on 11th january. And my classes are in the very early morning. Hopefully in the morning there will be electricity. 


Here is the [link](https://codepen.io/ifti891/pen/xxXJWYx?editors=1000) to the 2nd FreeCodeCamp Project. taking time actually. CSS, that is some wonderful technology but now knid of bit higher learning curve after when you learn some basic. HTML is also not that easy i would say. 

## Day 19: January 10, 2022

**Todays Progress**
1. Still working on the second [Project](https://codepen.io/ifti891/pen/xxXJWYx?editors=1000) of FreeCodeCamp.
2. Found a cool library to use called Sakura, but it's for fun only, will still be working on CSS myself.
3. Had the first office hour with Leon on Twitch. It was of three hours and it was fire.

**Thought's**

Started Leon's 30 weeks free bootcamp and God keep him healthy, what a nice person. Always wanted to learn coding but without feeling that i am not worth it or will not be able to do. That's what Leon is, he makes you believe in yourself. I will sure finish the bootcamp and get a wonderful job in tech as software engineer.

## Day 20: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Still working on the senond project, although didn't wored much today on the project. 
2. In the morning at 5 am there is first lecture of the Leon's Bootcamp.
   
**Thought's**
Not able to give much time to coding, though still giving some time. As i have to submit the PhD write-up but i am not even able to it the proper time. Working out!!!! And received my rejection letter for the job i applied.


## Day 21: January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Addented the first class of the 30 weeks bootcamp by Leon.
2. Lecture was of 3.20 hours, fairly long, and my room was super cold because there was no electricity and i had to watch from under the bedding.
3. Still sleepy feeling.
4. I am stuck in the 2 project, kind of bit hard actually. 

**Thought's**
I like the coding, but from last 2 days i been not set doing lot of other works. Such as trying to finish the PhD write-up; now there is another one is which i had to apply. Also have to apply for a PhD scholarship. Leon's class was fire, i liked it and it's free.

I learned using Anki app, wish i knew it earlier, i could have learned Python more better way. 

## Day 22: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. alome daily electricity cut of 18 hours really affecting my progress.
2.  And the other thing had lot of work in past 5 days, but still managed to look and learn some i.e. Attented 3.28 hours bootcam lecture with Leon. 
3.  Could not able to practice on FreeCodeCamp. 
4.  But in the morning it's the second class of the bootcamp. And it will be hell if there is still no electricity, because now its gone.

**Thought's**
Without electricty it's just another level of difficult beside not having internet and good computer. i wish i could afford a laptop so that i can buy one each for my two siblings.
Somehow i was able to submit my research proposal today. So not that bad except i badly wanted to learn from this Bootcamp.

## Day 23: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Attended the second lecture of #LearnWithLeon 30 weeks Fullstck Development bootcamp.
2. Built barebone webpage.
3. Working on the second page.
4. Lecture was of 3 hours and one of the best lecture. Wish i had some electricity i would have enjoyed it better.
5. started with the coursera course How to learn.


**Thought's**

I am enjoying coding, hopefully i will be able to complete this bootcamp and will be able to secure a better job. And i think i will be able to secure a better job. 
Don't know what will the result of my PhD for which i submitted the asked documents. I wish if this could be my chance. However, this time i am not that much worried if i didn't able to secure it like earlier. As i am happy be learning coding, becasue i enjoy it more than anything. If i didn't get tired of get sleepy i will always like to do coding, because that how much i enjoy coding and technology. 


## Day 34: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**
1. Completed the 2nd homework given in the bootcamp. really enoyed it. 
2. Built a basic replica of BBC.com 
3. Completed second weeks lecture of the course How to learn on Coursera. 


**Thought's**

Little less stress from yestraday after submitting the asked documents to professor for a PhD position. However, now i am not that much interested in a PhD. I think i enjoy coding way more. Actually, till now i have never enjoyed anything more than coding. I feel like this is what i was looking. Tho. inspite of this much, i been struggling to move past the wall of crossing basic HTML. And this is worrying me. I hope i will soon get past this wall of basic, i always get stuck here.
